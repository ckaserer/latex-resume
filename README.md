# Cover Letter & Curriculum Vitae

This simple Resume/CV template features a large sidebar with key information about you neatly presented for quick perusal. Your main skills can be quickly highlighted using a star based scale ranging from 0 to 5 stars, this is particularly useful for programming languages and other skills where time is required for mastery. The template body is then presented by partially colored section titles. Inside these, you can further divide content by subsection or simply write paragraphs. Lists of achievements or timelines can be constructed using one of two environments lists for usage within the main section or within the side bar section. The template can be extended to as many pages as you like while the sidebar can be different on each page.
